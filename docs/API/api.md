# REST API documentation

The REST API is functionally organised in four categories;

1. Authentication & Authorisation
1. Radar management
1. Project management
1. User management

Responses **always** use the JSEND way of sending responses (see https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend for more details) regardless if the operation was successful or not.

## Authorisation and Authentication model

Most of the available endpoints are protected hence not available for public, anonymous use.

The Cyberwatching Project Radar implements a simplified RBAC (role based access control) model with for "levels" of access control. Strictly speaking, each authenticated user must have a role assigned, however these roles are currently hierarchical, as follows:

Role          | Description
--------------|------------
public        | No authorisation required, i.e. public anonymous access to the resource
authenticated | A 'user' must be logged in (i.e. a JWT cookie must be sent with the request)
manager       | Managers are allowed to perform most create, update and delete operations on radars, projects, and users.
admin         | An admin is allowed to do everything on the server.

To this end the AuthN & AuthZ model implements a number of generic error messages that may be sent as response to any of the endpoints:

Error condition       | HTTP response code  | API error message 
----------------------|---------------------|------------------
User not logged in    | `401 Unauthorized`  | `You are not logged in! Please log in to get access.`
User no longer exists | `401 Unauthorized`  | `The user belonging to this token does no longer exist.`
Access denied         | `403 Forbidden`     | `You do not have permission to perform this action.`

## Data model

The data model for the Project Radar comprises of five major components that are accessible via the REST API to controll the behaviour and contents of the application:

Component      | Description
---------------|------------
User           | Models both end users (typically admins) and programmatic agents (typically managers of data) that access and manipulate instances and contents of the other components. [more...](user/user_model.md)
Radar          | A Radar comprises a snapshot of classified projects with or without MTRL scores that is rendered for visual display and analysis. [more...](radar/radar_model.md)
Project        | Projects collate static information about an EC funded project such as start and end time, funding call, budget, etc.
MTRL Score     | A MTRL Score documents a Project's maturity in Technology and go-to-market strategy at a given point in time.
Classification | A Classification models where it belongs in the Cyberwatching sybersecurity and privacy (CS & P) research taxonomy. The segments of a Radar are based on the six second-tier in the CS & P taxonomy.
