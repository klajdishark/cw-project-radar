# Cyberwatching Project Radar

This Cyberwatching Project Radar is a rewrite of of the first attempt that was based on the original ThoughtWorks radar.

This version is written from scratch as a full stack application using Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and a few other libraries.

## Running the Radar using Docker

1. [Download and install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) Docker (and docker compose) for your target platform.
1. [Download](https://github.com/micheldrescher/cw-project-radar/archive/master.zip) this repository as a ZIP file, or clone it using Git: `git clone https://github.com/micheldrescher/cw-project-radar.git`
1. CD into the project repository
1. Run the command `docker-compose up` to assemble the docker images and start the Project Radar.
1. Open http://localhost:8080/user/login, log in as 'admin' using the password 'temporary'.
1. Browse to `http://localhost:8080/user/account` and change the initial admin account's password.

This will give you a blank Cyberwatching Project Radar application in production mode.

Data in the database will be stored in a persistent volume managed by Docker. 

Play around with adding users, projects, radars, MTRL scores and classifications.

### Adding Cyberwatching baseline data

Cyberwatching.eu regularly publishes baseline data extracted from its production service in this repository.

Previously exported baseline data will be archived into a suitably named compressed file for your perusal. The latest export will be available as JSON files.

To add the latest baseline data to your local radar instance, run the following commands:

1. On the command line, run `docker ps` to find out about the id of the docker container running off the `cw-radar-mongo:latest` image.
1. Start an interactive shell in the docker container: `docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash` where \<id\> is the container id from the previous step
1. Run `/scripts/import.sh` to populate the database with the latest baseline data.

To use archived baseline data, unzip the respective ZIP file, overwriting the files in the current directory (make backups if you want to keep the latest baseline), and then run the import shell script.
