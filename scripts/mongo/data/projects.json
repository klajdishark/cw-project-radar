Europe's interests, sensitivities, and commitment to liberal values in Cyber security and privacy are not necessarily aligned to those of other leading world actors. Therefore, leaning back and expecting others to solve the problems is not likely to lead to optimal outcomes for Europe. However, for Europe to move to a pro-active role, it has to exercise its power potential by achieving a sufficient degree of coordination among Member States. In addition, Europe's ability to influence how Cyber security and privacy issues are handled is also key to the competitiveness of European industries in the field.<br/>CAPITAL has been built around two pillars: coordinate European R&D efforts in the cyber security domain and jointly address research and innovation within an Integrated Research & Innovation Agenda. The project will therefore cover two sub-bullets of the call objective.<br/>CAPITAL is proposed by a strong consortium gathering nine representatives from leading Industries and Research Organisations, well positioned -in terms of networking, expertise and market outreach - in the cyber security domain. CAPITAL complements the CYSPA project started on October 2012, also coordinated by EOS which aims at defining an overall strategy and creating a community of solution providers, Researchers and end-users to enhance the industrial community to protect itself from cyber-disruptions and support the European elaboration of regulations to enhance the overall protection level.",

	"teaser": "Innovation drives new product realisation and development. Significant opportunities exist for innovation in the privacy and cyber security (PACS) technology space, yet complex market, regulatory, policy, commercial, and economic considerations create several barriers to transforming research outputs into market-centric product and service applications. In response, Innovation Framework for Privacy and Cyber Security Market Opportunities (IPaCSO) will develop a structured knowledge and decision-support innovation framework for identifying, assessing and exploiting market opportunities in the privacy and cyber security technology space. IPaCSO will support security innovators, policy makers and research spectrum stakeholders in identifying, assessing and exploiting new ideas and research assets using innovation and market assessment best-practice and guidelines and bringing them to market.Achieving project impact objectives can be challenging for ICT security research projects thus through the adoption and utilisation of the IPaCSO innovation framework we propose that projects can increase the impact of their project results. IPaCSO will address the following main goals:Â\\tAssess existing innovation processes used in the PACS domain via in-depth stakeholder engagementÂ\\tIdentifiy a set of innovation framework requirements, interleaving improved innovation practices and case study scenarios, that support PACs domain concernsÂ\\tAssess existing economic barriers to innovation and identify appropriate economic incentives needed to increase security product and service adoptionÂ\\tDevelop an appropriate knowledgebase and decision support approach that is transferrable to PACS technologies exploiting potential market opportunities.Â\\tDevelop effective training, exploitation and dissemination of the resultant IPaCSO framework to target stakeholder groups, both during and beyond the project lifecycle.The proposed work will focus on key thematic areas within the PACs domain, for example, security concerns across different OSI layers, emerging mobile and telecoms security, security monitoring and incident response, emerging notions of privacy and identity, embedded security, and emerging managed security services models. Such concerns will be considered in the context of wider ICT factors such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, emerging internets of services and things, and similar IT macro factors. IPaCSO project activities will lead to a structured understanding of such thematic market areas, a clearer understanding of how existing market barriers can be addressed within innovation frameworks, providing practical support for PACs stakeholders in producing improved market focussed outputs in the future.",

'Panoptes' is an ancient Greek term meaning 'all eyes' or 'all seeing'. This term has incorporated into the project name to represent the PANOPTESEC consortium because the overall goal of the PANOPTESEC project is to deliver a continuous cyber security monitoring and response capability.<br/>Organizations have become increasingly dependent on networks and computer systems to support their business operations and services. Unfortunately, as this dependency has grown, the motives and capabilities of cyber adversaries to attack these systems are also increasing. Attackers are often able to penetrate computer systems to extract sensitive information, tamper with accuracy of the information and prevent access to essential services. Given the organizational dependency on the systems and services, any one of these tactics can have significant negative impacts on an organization's business capabilities, reputation and liabilities. In the era of open networks and platforms, attackers continue to find more venues to exploit these systems to cause substantial damage.<br/>Despite the well-known need for continuous monitoring of ICT systems to detect vulnerabilities and attacks, as well as the need for rapid incident response, commercial solutions do not meet the demands of modern networks and systems.<br/>The PANOPTESEC prototype will address these challenges by proactively and reactively evaluating system weaknesses, identifying potential attack paths, providing a list of prioritized response actions, and delivering a means to execute these responses; all supported by automated analysis engines. The resulting PANOPTESEC prototype will provide a continuous monitoring and response capability to prevent, detect, manage and react to cyber incidents in real-time. The near market-ready system will support breach notifications and improve situation awareness while supporting the decision-making process required by security personnel. PANOPTESEC will deliver this capability through an integrated and modular, standards-based integration of technologies that will collectively deliver the required capabilities.",

	"teaser": "Modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCIs), e.g. the electrical grid, rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for their operation since ICT can lead to cost reduction as well as greater efficiency, flexibility and interoperability between components. In the past NCIs were isolated environments and used proprietary hardware and protocols, limiting thus the threats that could affect them. Nowadays, with the adoption of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) ICT, NCIs are exposed to significant cyber threats that can lead to economical and human losses.    To address the aforementioned issues, this project aims at elaborating novel holistic methodologies for the design of security and resilience-aware ICT infrastructures for NCIs. The project will develop state-of-the-art techniques and tools to aid engineers in designing secure and resilient industrial ICT-based installations.    The novelty of the project consists in the fact that it will fuse together the cyber and physical dimensions of NCI, an important aspect that is missing from existing approaches. The project will create novel NCI network design techniques by solving multi-criteria optimization problems that take into account several aspects such as NCI design standards, e.g. NIST SP 800-82 and NERC CIP 002-009, resilient operation of physical process, but also installation-specific information, e.g. geographical aspects. The project will also provide more effective protection mechanisms, e.g. cyber-physical Intrusion Detection Systems, by combining data from cyber and physical sensors.    The proposed research lies in the context of the 'European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection' (EPCIP), the 'Critical Information Infrastructure Protection' (CIIP) action plan and the 'Digital Agenda for Europe' (DAE) by addressing key security and resilience issues of NCIs that will ultimately lead to the better protection of existing and future Critical Infrastructures.'",

	"teaser": "SecureCloud addresses the confidentiality, integrity and availability of applications executed in the cloud. Data at rest or in transit on the network is already nowadays protected by encryption. The main problem that we face is how to ensure the confidentiality of data while being processed. Our approach is based on upcoming hardware extensions of commodity CPUs like Intel's Secure Guard Extensions (SGX). By the help of these hardware extensions, we reduce the trusted computing base dramatically by excluding from it the millions of lines of source code of the cloud stack, operating systems and hypervisor. This permits us to ensure the confidentiality of computations even if the computers are under a different administrative control (like a cloud provider) or there is no physical security of the computers. Moreover, we ensure the confidentiality even if attackers would take control of the cloud stack, the hypervisor or the operating systems. As long as the hardware extensions of the CPU can be trusted, we can ensure the confidentiality of the computations.   SecureCloud focuses on ensuring the confidential and dependable processing of Big Data. To keep the trusted computing base small, we use the concept of microservices: only the application logic that processes data (e.g., operators) is protected while all functionality that, e.g., shuffles and stores encrypted data is outside the trusted computing base. By monitoring the microservices, we can restart services that run on compromised hosts. We will evaluate and demonstrate our approach in the context of smart grids. In this use case context, we need to run across a physically distributed computing infrastructure with no or little physical security and partly untrusted administrators. We need to process large volumes of data and this big data processing would benefit by partial offloading into the cloud. In SecureCloud, we will show how to do this in a secure fashion even if clouds are untrusted.",

A significant level of resistance, to sharing and enforcement of IP, is damaging supply chain partnerships and the manufacturing production processes that rely upon them; costs to industry estimated at millions of euro (NFF Symposium, 2013). This project, spanning 6 months, will investigate the feasibility of bringing to market a novel solution for protecting intellectual property across enterprise boundaries and will support a go to market plan for Ascema for Supply Chains, a patented technology that protects high value content across enterprise boundaries.     The European Parliament ' Recognises that the enforcement of IPR is not merely a driver for jobs and growth across the Union but is essential for the proper functioning of the single market and plays a key role in stimulating innovation, creativity, competitiveness and cultural diversity.' (Towards a renewed consensus on the enforcement of IPR: An EU Action Plan, May 15). Ascema offers a disruptive solution where currently no other solutions exist. This project will undertake a feasibility study, including a full business plan, to verify the technological, practical and economic viability of GeoLangâs novel Ascema for Supply Chains data loss prevention platform.     A planned Phase 2 project will provide a preproduction prototype of a digital information fingerprinting and tracking mechanism across boundaries with processes and requirements for inclusion within supply chain contractual arrangements identified that will support the market take-up of this novel platform which has won GeoLang Ltd the prize of UK's Most Innovative Small Cyber Security Company 2015. The results will support the uptake by industry of a technology that offers safe sharing of intellectual property in supply chains facilitating growth within the single market.'",

Significant R&D carried out over the last ten years within the Centre for Secure IT (CSIT) in Belfast has resulted in the development of a number of unique algorithms in the area of VISEME ANALYSIS. CSIT is a â¬40M innovation and knowledge centre based at Queen's University Belfast (QUB). With over 90 research staff in information security and cyber-physical security, it is the UKâs largest research centre in cyber security. It is recognised by the UK Research Council and GCHQ as an Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research, specialising in fields such as applied cryptography, network security systems, critical infrastructure protection and intelligent surveillance systems.     Implementation of the Viseme Analysis algorithms has demonstrated, through testing with a number of large and independent data sets, that leveraging the technology for user authentication can be highly accurate and secure. When accessing a sensitive application on e.g. a mobile device, the user is asked to say or mouth a random challenge phrase which is displayed on screen. The system provides secure user authentication AND verifies 'liveness' to ensure that the system is not being 'spoofed' - a common weakness with most biometric techniques.    In 2015 Liopa Limited was formed as the commercial vehicle to onward develop and productise this technology. This feasibility study aims to do a detailed study of the market for biometric authentication systems, determine market requirements and potential market verticals, demonstrate an early version of the technology to a prospective customers in their environment, and product a high level business plan for the development and market introduction of a commercial product.'",

Estimates of global financial losses due to cyber-crime are at least â¬350 billion per year and are expected to reach â¬1.89 trillion by 2019. Cyber-crime has led to the loss of up to 150,000 jobs in Europe, which is about 0.6% of the total unemployed population. In response to cyber-crime, we initiated âConnectProtectâ in 2012, a total cyber protection service for SMEs and residential customers.    We worked with about 20 SMEs in the UK to build this service and up to date, we developed a reporting engine capable of correlating events/logs from multiple security products across multiple organisations and constantly updating each event in real-time to generate the relevant classification of potential threat. The report engine is able to generate a case for our engineers to deal with an incident in real-time and allowing the customer to view their security state via a dashboard. We aim to further establish and understand our target market and conduct a detailed Europe wide cyber-security market study to establish the size and dynamics of the small business market; engage developmental, operational, and marketing partners for successful delivery of this project.    We also seek to develop an Intellectual Property (IP) strategy to protect our solution from exploitation by other parties. Through this project we will reduce the cyber security burden in the EU from an average of â¬280 to between â¬10 and â¬70 per employee per month and we will create over 100 jobs through native sales language teams that would be set up in our various target countries. We will potentially save SMEs over 20% (i.e. over â¬1 billion) of revenue lost to cyber-crime in Europe.",

The solution has been designed to answer the business opportunity that lays in plausible cyber-security market trends:  (1) Steady growth of online transactions & cyber attacks/ online fraud at the same time;  (2) Rise of as-a-service model providers & market (9.8%/ p.a.);  (3) Pressure to decrease high expenses for complex security.    The ultimate goal of this project is to bring to market system ThreatMark capable of improving the security of transactions and decreasing the resources needed. Four target groups were identified: on-line banks, high value transactions providers, secure apps, emerging digital services. Some strategic alliances with business partners exist.  The sub-objectives of FS include requirements analysis, detailed business plan, technology roadmap update and company development strategy based on innovation management training.    The company has already invested into its technology more than 200 000 EUR (equipment, travel, 1 500 own man-days, 2 000 man-days of academic partners from 2013). To fully enter the market in 2017 a strategic investment or funding is requested.",

	"teaser": "Today there are around 800 million connected devices in Smart Homes, which forecasted to reach 2 billion devices by 2020 - an uptick of about 250 million new devices per year. Smart Home networks become crowded, difficult to maintain and vulnerable. Todayâs Smart Home systems, such as smart TVs, Internet-connected camera systems, alarm sensors, smart light bulbs or thermostats, can be hacked only in few minutes and provide a wealth of data about the way people live, bank information, legal information and etc.  Perytons proposes a centralized diagnostic solution for the Smart Home Operators, called Eye-O-T. The Eye-O-T enables the operators to monitor and analyze in real time a large number of IoT networks, distributed over many remote sites and running different local communication protocols. The system is composed by plug & play probes that capture Smart Home IoT edge and gateway traffics and send it to the cloud through the existing broadband infrastructure; and an intuitive real-time dashboard. The Eye-O-T security system not only enables Smart Home owners to minimise their house and privacy vulnerability to security breaches and malicious attacks, but also reduces the Smart Home maintenance cost for operators by 30% and increases the operatorâs deployment capacity of at least 10%.  The Phase 1 project will allow Perytons to define a minimum viable product, plan a feasible cyber security and centralized monitoring system scale-up, elaborate the business scale up, and size the reachable market and a reliable market share. Within the overall project, Perytons aims to: scale up the solution to be able to support large scale IoT network deployment, ingrate the system with one large cloud service, interface the solution with common Network Management solutions and demonstrate Eye-O-T visibility and security trough a large scale pilot in houses with 300 probes deployed in Germany and the UK together with Smart Home Operators.",

	"teaser": "Dashboard is an early stage technology company formed to develop and market an automated remote monitoring solution for the collection and consolidation of near-real-time data from sensors in both remote and accessible locations. As a cleantech company Dashboard is rooted in the transformational power of data analytics, and through the knowledge and skills of our experienced team of hardware, programming and communications professionals, has developed Limpet, an alternative solution to monitoring pipelines for leaks and breaches.    The global pipeline industry has a growing problem with leak and breach detection, costing billions and causing long lasting and highly destructive environmental damage. Limpet is at the forefront of improving low cost oil and gas pipeline monitoring, limiting the economic and environmental impact of any leaks or breaches. The solution, through the utilisation of novel ultrasonic flow rate measurement and innovative collar design, offers vastly improved detection rates, cheaper installation and running costs per km, improved device lifecycle, retro-fitting capabilities and advanced cyber security of both the device and data. The result is a potential installation saving of $999,250 per km and a yearly saving of $16,800 per km.    This feasibility study is designed to verify the technical, market/commercial and financial feasibility of Limpet, cumulating in a detailed report that will contain an optimal design plan, skills analysis, IPR strategy, market/competitor report, financial model for commercialisation and risk analysis.    The commercialisation of Limpet, initially in the EU, will see the solution positioned as the market leading flow rate leak detection system for oil and gas pipelines. The primary target will be EU companies with existing or planned onshore, above-ground pipelines. By the 4th year of commercialisation we expect to generate revenues of â¬30m, have a team of 73, and have a leading position in the leak detection market.",

	"teaser": "The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from â¬1.03 to â¬0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. â¬456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. â¬1.44 billion annually and â¬14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to â¬13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the userâs mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%. Among other things, the purpose of Feasibility Study is to better understand the target market, determine optimum platform resources required to handle a given volume of transactions and to further refine IP strategy.",

Traditional protection solutions are costly and bureaucratic  processes relying on legacy centralized monopolistic institutions (notaries, collecting societies). PROOFY is tailored for creators and marketers of original content, enabling safe deposit and management of original work, being extremely easy (1-step procedure), fast (3min), inexpensive (â¬15/author/year) and entirely online.  PROOFY revolutionizes IP protection being the only solution to ensure data integrity, certification of genuineness and authorship, with a fully automatic uploading process and secure storage services. Having successfully penetrated the  Italian market (2,000 B2C users in 2017), we will secure our European position and introduce PROOFY to global markets (US and Asian). The PROOFY B2C component has been tested, validated and demonstrated both technically and commercially. We are now expanding the B2B component, and are planning to perform pilot tests in operational scenarios, for which partnerships and agreements are already in place. During the Phase 1 we will perform the technical and commercial assessment of PROOFY (design, functionalities, scale-up, security, market demands), so as  to become the leading provider of Online Copyright Protection Services in EU and to penetrate the US and Asian markets with the most efficient solution. We will also develop a detailed Business and Financial Plan to analyse the economic viability of PROOFY. The successful implementation of this project will raise EUâs worldwide rank in copyright protection, and will stimulate job creations in the Creative Industry domain, which is the largest employment sector for young people and contributes to over 3% of EUâs GDP.",

In the EU the cost of  cybercrime has reached â¬871 billion a year and fraudulent card transactions amounted to â¬1.27 billion. The high number of  online frauds coupled with the low level of cybersecurity deters businesses, and in particular SMEs who may not be able to  afford comprehensive anti-fraud services, from fully exploiting the potential of e-commerce. UNFRAUD is a software product  that prevents potential online fraud scenarios by analysing previous and current fraudulent invents through deep learning  artificial intelligence to tackle the new challenges that fraudsters devise. UNFRAUDâs algorithms are similar to oneâs used by  Google for self driving cars and facial recognition (i.e. deep AI that recognizes human errors, behaviours and surroundings)  and through this deep learning it is able to detect 'fraudulent' behaviour. This makes UNFRAUD much more reliable as well  as greatly reducing the cost of anti-fraud services, allowing companies to operate and grow safely. During the Phase 1  feasibility study the project will focus on identifying and securing the key partners required for commercialisation,  establishing a sound business model and commercialization strategy, and planning a pilot test with a bank, big e-commerce,  enterprise, telecommunication company and public administration in order to fully demonstrate and assess the products  capabilities.'",

Current suppliers of Security Awareness Computer Based Training (CBT) provide training content, without being able to demonstrate end user behavioural change, only measuring training attendance or specific behaviours (pshishing assessments) that do not describe the complete use behaviours.  In contrast with existing solutions, the CLTRe Toolkit is assessing the actual ideas, habits and behaviours of the employees in order to measure and improve the security culture of an organisation. The solution stores behavioural assessments over time to provide the organization with trend analysis in order to understand behavioural change over time. CLTRe offers the first the application of social sciences to measure and improve the security culture of an organization, based on a robust framework and a comprehensive toolkit. The CLTRe approach addresses the â¬2.6B security computer-based training and can help reduce the 121M data breaches recorded in 2015. The CTLRe toolkit leverages the existing footprint of the Security Culture Framework (a free tool developed by CTLRe and already used by 20,000 users).

	"teaser": "The annual cost of cybercrime is estimated to reach nearly â¬3 trillion by 2019 and the value of the cyber security market will hit â¬100 billion. Across the EU, 68% of Internet users say they are concerned about identity theft. The highest levels of concern can be observed in France (where 80% are concerned) and Spain (79%). The problem for many people is that they are unsure how to protect themselves from these attacks on their security and privacy. This has several knock-on effects, including reduced consumer confidence, identity theft, lost revenue, lost intellectual property, and reputational damage to companies and individuals. InvizBox Go 4G provides an innovative approach to securing data on the internet and protecting user privacy with ease. InvizBox Go 4G addresses a major market opportunity by bringing to market a solution for cyber-security that currently is only available to companies and consumers by installing and configuring software on each and every device that they wish to protect. The Go 4G project will look to conduct a full technical and economic feasibility study of InvizBox Go 4G and develop a business strategy that ensures that the productâs commercial potential is maximized. The accomplishment of the project objectives will boost company growth and internationalization with an expected accumulated turnover of â¬19.9 million over 5 years after commercialization and generating 20 new jobs. It will also contribute to strengthening the EU competitiveness in the Cyber Security industry.",

	"teaser": "According to the International Labour Organisation â ILO , more than 2.3 million worker dies from a work-related accident every year. The economic burden of poor occupational safety and health practices is estimated at 4% of global GDP.  The 4.0 Industry is an environment where there are more and more vehicles without drivers, robots and machines it is necessary that people can share the place in a safe and healthy way. Therefore, the 4.0 Industry needs more security, which can be provided by our innovative approach.   Today, the main technological challenge our customers face is to design a protection and positioning system that is precise, reliable, adaptable, low-cost and low intrusive. CLAITEC is driven to answer these needs, overcoming technical limitations that RFID systems has After 3 years of development, we characterised our own IR-Ultra-Wide Band technology including distance calculation algorithms to use as the basis of the products in development.  Our location system aims to warn/intervene drivers of vehicles when a risk situation occur (pedestrian run over, vehicle collision). The broadband of coverage ranges from 0.2 to 30 meters with an accuracy of 10cm.  Willingness-to-pay is driven by two main factors: The cost of an accident / Legal obligations. We want to perform an in-depth market study on the early adopters (logistics, construction, recycling, agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) followed by a geographical analysis. CLAITEC must identify process constraints and study the prototype industrialisation. The feasibility study will address a financial plan, foreseeing the all costs and investments associated with commercialising the product and the expected revenues in 5-years. The study will also aim assess legal aspects such as product certification according to European/Foreign legislation. All these activities will lead to the elaboration of a detailed business plan that would pave the way towards the commercialization of SAFETY 4.0.",

Due to security problems (easy to spoof), they do not meet the end-user requirements when true security and strong authentication is needed. Because ultrasound waves easily travel inside matter, a fingerprint sensor based on ultrasound provides significantly more secure authentication as it is able to capture 3D features. Ultrasound sensor is as convenient to use as other competing fingerprint sensors. Thus far, full benefits of ultrasound technology have not yet been used to meet the all end-user needs. MODULEUS will exploit technological advantages of ultrasound to address end-user needs related to high security confidence, usage convenience and privacy safeguard.

	"teaser": "Nowadays, individuals and businesses are more concerned about privacy and security than in the past and demand more secure and reliable products and services. Moreover, on May 25 2018, a new European privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will come into effect. This regulation will be implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU region and it will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe. To achieve GDPR compliance, organisations will have to secure all communication channels (email, chat, data sharing) with customers, for which end-to-end encryption will play a key role. In such a scenario, companies have no choice than quickly adapt their data protection procedures and acquire technology that complies with the new regulation.   ProtonSuite will is the first cloud-based cybersecure collaboration platform that provides users with end-to-end secure communication channels and collaboration tools. The platform is built following the essence of privacy by design, which means that privacy is taken into account from the inception of the product concept. Furthermore, the solution goes even further and tackles the biggest problem that is preventing the encryption to reach the mass audience: key distribution and key authentication.   Our aim is to bring to the market ProtonSuite in 2020 with a clear vision in mind: democratize data privacy and security. Our commercial success will be based on our ability to up-sale the product to our existing customer base, attract new customers and foster our collaboration with open source community (GitHub, OpenPGP) and universities (EPFL, MIT), which are acting as our prominent evangelists.   After the completion of the project, with the product commercialization we will achieve a forecasted cumulative revenue of â¬ 98 Million. Considering the funding for phase 2 (1.8M â¬), we forecast a R.O.I of 6.9 (2020-2024) while payback will be reached in 2021.",

Our technology is more economical, more accurate, and safer than the current available train positioning solutions such as Eurobalises, odometers or Doppler Effect Cinemometers. The RPS solution is based on two devices, the RPS Radar which is a high-frequency radar installed on the train that obtains a detailed ground profile and the RPS Balises, a set of plastic pieces attached in certain railway sleepers. We seek to exploit RPS technology by marketing 2 different services. The first is our Efficient Speed Control service that will allow metro and railway operators to establish an optimal map of speeds for their trains. With this tool they will be able to adapt train speed to the optimal energy consumption instead of using sections at a constant speed as is currently done. The second is our Target Braking service that will allow signalling companies a smooth deceleration of the trains in stations until they stop at a precise point. With this tool they will be able to provide a greater comfort and safety to passengers, improve energy efficiency and deploy Platform Screen Doors reliably and at a low cost. Up to now, thanks to the effort and commitment of our valuable professional team, we have raised â¬720,000 from different agencies of the Spanish Government, we possess 9 patents, we have tested the core of our technology in a real environment with renowned customers such as Madrid Metro and Talgo, we have received awards from the technological and entrepreneurship sectors and we have established strong alliances and received the support of key stakeholders such as Indra and Renfe.",

	"teaser": "Cybercrime has recently shifted from attacking big corporations to smaller industries, like financial services as well as the healthcare sector. Especially in the last area the trend is rising, where hackers are targeting patient health devices that are connected to the internet. Most cases include stealing patient information and encrypting it for ransom money. The big problem is interconnection, each application or device that runs on the networks represents a possible entry point for a cyber-physical attack. So far, most hackers infected hospital software with ransomware to prevent staff from accessing patient records or scheduling appointments. But capable terrorists would also be able, to render active medical devices not just useless, but deadly. Complete cybersecurity in the health sector is unachievable, and would exceed financial means; nevertheless, vital steps can be taken to minimize the risk of cyber- attacks against healthcare facilities. Around 85 percent of targeted cyber-attacks would be preventable if basic protection protocols would be established. The SecureHospitals.eu project seeks to raise awareness on risks and protection opportunities, setup training schemes and the initiate training sessions for IT staff working in hospitals. Through several training approaches, the project will boost the level of training in cybersecurity in Europe, improve the knowledge of staff and in turn contribute to decreased vulnerabilities against cyberthreats and increased patient trust and safety.",

The core idea of the project is derived from two observations. The first is based on an extensive analysis of the market on currently available cloud-based health services that aim to preserve usersâ privacy without sacrificing functionality. From this study, we observed the following: âOnce data is placed on the cloud in an unencrypted form or encrypted with a key that is known to the cloud service provider, data privacy becomes an illusionâ. The second observation is based on the consideration of the latest advancements in cryptography. More precisely, one of the saddest but at the same time most fascinating things about cryptography is how little cryptography we actually use. While researchers have developed many theoretical models that could enhance the security level of healthcare services, only a rudimentary set of techniques are currently in use. ASCLEPIOS is addressing these limitations by utilizing several modern cryptographic approaches to build a cloud-based eHealth framework that protects usersâ privacy and prevents both internal and external attacks. ASCLEPIOS also offers the ability to users to verify the integrity of their medical devices prior using them while at the same time receiving certain guarantees about the trustworthiness of their cloud service provider. Furthermore, ASCLEPIOS offers a novel solution through which healthcare practitioners and medical researchers are able to calculate statistics on medical data in a privacy-preserving way. Finally, a list of activities with the aim to raise security awareness within the healthcare industry will be organized by project. All these results will be showcased by three real-life near production quality demonstrators provided by ASCLEPIOS healthcare partners, involving three leading European hospitals.",

At the same time, a breach of integrity of health data can have dramatic consequences for the patients affected. CUREX addresses comprehensively the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of health data by producing a novel, flexible and scalable situational awareness-oriented platform. It allows a healthcare provider to assess the realistic cybersecurity and privacy risks they are exposed to and suggest mathematically optimal strategies for addressing these risks with safeguards tailored specifically for each business case and application. CUREX is fully GDPR compliant by design. At its core, a decentralised architecture enhanced with a private blockchain infrastructure ensures the integrity of the risk assessment process and of all data transactions that occur between the diverse range of stakeholders involved. Crucially, CUREX expands beyond technical measures and places emphasis also on improving cyber hygiene through training and raising awareness activities for a healthcare institutionâs personnel. Its validation focuses on the highly challenging condition of (cross-border) health data exchange, spanning patient cross-border mobility, remote healthcare, and data exchange for research. CUREX consortium will also utilise the outcomes of the well-known MyHealthMyData project in a dedicated demonstration that will use their blockchain-enabled platform which will control the actual data exchange.

However, cyberattacks in EU are costing businesses around â¬38 billion/ year. How can we maximise our protection against these risks? Our company, Prosa Security, is developing V-SPHERE; a new solution for industrial cyber security that unveils and prevents vulnerabilities of any ICT system in a holistic way, i.e., covering all the development cycle and all company perspectives. Involving all the stakeholders in the security process, this unique approach has demonstrated to be 10 to 100 times more effective in detection than traditional methods, as well as to reduce by 3 the time allocated for quality and security assurance in SW development projects, resulting in saving from â¬45,000 to â¬300,000 per SW development project. The overall objectives of this project are: assessing the viability of V-SPHERE and building a solid business and operational plan (Phase 1); conducting the planned technical and commercial activities to prepare its commercialisation (Phase 2); and initiate the formal large scale commercialisation, seeking the promotion of V-SPHERE and the networking with financers (Phase 3). Our business opportunity is promising, with the European market of cybersecurity to reach â¬38.10 billion and the specific market of security testing solutions valued at â¬2.71 billion in 2022. The expected outcome of the project is estimated at â¬23.3 million by 2023, besides the creation of 27 job positions.",

AF-Cyber will relieve part of the cyberattacks problem, by supporting forensics investigation and attribution with logical-based frameworks representation, reasoning and supporting tools.   AF-Cyber main core will be a logic-based framework for performing attribution of cyber attacks, based on forensics evidence and an intelligent methodology for dynamic evidence collection. It will analyse and valuate analytically Cyber Forensics applications. Different forensics reasoning rules and techniques will be extracted and a categorization of forensics evidence will be constructed. A new logical formalism will be introduced for representing the analytical and non-monotonic reasoning needed for solving the attribution problem. A tool, based on the logical framework for the attribution reasoning, will be developed. The tool will be tested with different real examples. The tool given the different evidence gives as result a quantitative/probabilistic answer of where the attack came from. A second version of the tool will be developed which will guide the forensics analyst during his work on collecting the evidence, and reasoning about them. A dynamic forensics evidence collection will be designed based on the different reasoning rules, and the involvement of data mining/machine learning algorithms.

SIGAGuard is the first cybersecurity solution today that monitors electrical signals generated between the control systems (PLC) and the end-point. This is important because 1) it makes the SIGA technology itself immune to cyber-attacks, as well as completely transparent to cyber-attacks on the SCADA system it is monitoring, and 2) it means that SIGAGuard effectively âinsulatesâ the SCADA-controlled equipment from any outside interference (hacking) via the rest of the system, and can provide accurate early warning when an anomaly is detected, reducing unexpected equipment damage and increasing operational safety, efficiency, and reliability.  SIGAGuard has successfully been tested with 2 large Israeli operators (Hagihon Water Company and Israel Electric Corporation) and is ready to be rolled out into the critical infrastructure protection market, estimated to grow from â¬90Bn in 2016 to â¬130 Bn by 2021 (source: Market and Markets).   SIGAGuard is sold as a package of hardware and software (one-time fee depending on size/complexity, average â¬250k per customer) plus a 15% annual fee for service & maintenance. Unlike competing solutions that can be deceived by advanced malware able to feed fake operational parameters to supervisory systems, SIGAGuard is deployed at the lowest tier of the infrastructure (end point), providing direct feedback on the physical parameters (electric signals) of the industrial components to be monitored. This capability makes SIGAGuard the first uncircumventable solution for the detection of anomalies in critical infrastructures.   SIGA is led by the former Director and the Deputy Director of Israelâs National Cyber Security Authority.",

	"teaser": "Modern society is increasingly dependent on electronic networks and information systems, but the evolution of ICT systems has also brought rapid growth of criminal activity that threatens citizens, businesses, governments and critical infrastructures. The cost of cybercrime reached â¬500B (2015) and continues to increase. Furthermore, according to EC Cybersecurity research ransomware attacks have increased by 300% since 2015. This situation with exponentially growing cybercrime numbers demonstrates that traditional antivirus protects only from KNOWN malware variants, but criminals are always one step ahead. This leaves the end users (mainly SMEâs and home users) and thus European economy highly vulnerable. ROMAD Holding Ltd is a cyber security startup company originally founded in 2012 in Ukraine (registered in Cyprus). Our ground-breaking next generation endpoint defence platform will be the first able to address the burning needs of the industry. The key innovation of True Proactiveâ¢ lays on the concept of malware families and their immutable behavioral characteristics. Our platform genetically sequencing entire malware families, enabling proactively detect and block new strains. We aim at bringing Romad True Proactiveâ¢ to the market in 2021. Further testing and intensive development of core architecture, processing apparatus and the Genome database must be performed before commercialisation. During current (Phase 1) project we will re-evaluate the commercialization plan, incl. identifying target entry markets, identify most suitable distributors on each of entry markets, define strategy how to approach them.  Finally, based on our Initial business plan a business opportunity of â¬115M arises for ROMAD Holding Ltd. We plan to make cumulative profit of â¬46M and hire at least 40 new employees by the 5th year of commercialization. Our mission is to give TrueProactiveâ¢ v2.0 for free of charge to schools and universities.",

Thus they are a primary target for criminals having a multiplier effect on the power of attacks and providing enormous resonance and gains. Also extreme weather events and natural disasters represents a challenge due to their increase in frequency and intensity requiring smarter resilience of the Communication CIs, which are extremely vulnerable due to the ever-increasing complexity of the architecture also in light of the evolution towards 5G, the extensive use of programmable platforms and exponential growth of connected devices. The fact that most enterprises still manage physical and cyber security independently represents a further challenge.   RESISTO platform is an innovative solution for Communication CIs holistic situation awareness and enhanced resilience (aligned with ECSO objectives). Based on an Integrated Risk and Resilience analysis management and improvement process availing all resilience cycle phases (prepare, prevent, detect, absorb, etc.) and technical resilience capabilities (sense, model, infer, act, adopt), RESISTO implements an innovative Decision Support System to protect communication infrastructures from combined cyber-physical threats exploiting the Software Defined Security model on a suite of state of the art cyber/physical security components (Blockchain, Machine Learning, IoT security, Airborne threat detection, holistic audio-video analytics) and services (Responsible Disclosure Framework) for detection and reaction in presence of attacks or natural disasters.  Through RESISTO Communications Operators, will be able to implement a set of mitigation actions and countermeasures that significantly reduce the impact of negative events in terms of performance losses, social consequences, and cascading effects in particular by bouncing efficiently back to original and forward to operational states of operation.",

Secure IoT is an urgent need in numerous industrial sectors. 48% of companies using IoT have been affected by breaches with detrimental impact on revenue and reputation. Cybersecurity is one of the main drivers of the IoT market growing at a CAGR of 44% but current solutions fail to provide needed protection.  Strong IoT cybersecurity needs to eliminate all exploitable weak points that can be used for user and IoT device identity theft, device takeover, data theft, DDoS, cloning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks, being scalable and suitable for even the simplest devices e.g. sensors. Passwords and actionable credentials for Human to Machine (H2M) and Machine to Machine (M2M) authentication in IoT are the weakest link in cybersecurity today and credentials theft is a huge global problem. For users, passwords are a frustrating experience and for business a major cybersecurity risk.  The solution: ELIoT (Easy&Lightweight IoT Protector) â an end-to-end cybersecurity solution for IoT networks. For H2M authentication in IoT environments the solution eliminates passwords â nothing for hackers to steal. Our core technology is based on the One-Time Password (OTP) user authentication protocol, mathematically proven unbreakable. For M2M in IoT environments ELIoT Pro ensures secure device-to-device authentication and data security using a lightweight encryption protocol. Unlike other crypto methods it is suitable for even simple sensors and saves battery power, which extends device lifespan.  Our system is universal, easy to deploy, easy to use and ultra-secure. It is highly compatible with the growing trend of voice-controlled IoT hubs e.g. Alexa. Our 5 global technology partners are eager to license and integrate ELIoT into their IoT products, spreading its use in various IoT markets and driving company growth.",

As per IDC, global revenues for Big Data and business analytics will grow from $bn 151 in 2017 to more than $bn 210 in 2020, a CAGR of 11.9%.     The constant discovery of vulnerabilities in ICT components, applications, services and systems is placing the entire digital society at risk. As private and public stakeholders are becoming increasingly dependent on critical cyber-infrastructure, new solutions are needed to increase detection and response capabilities.      Collecting, transferring, processing, analyzing and eventually fusing Big Data remains a complex R&D topic for even the most advanced organization. Those that can surpass the challenges and extract business value will gain significant competitive advantages. Distributed data fusion based on DataUniTorâs Blocknetwork scheme enables a highly secure but still âlightweightâ solution capable of handling flowing petabytes (10^15) of data. Blocknetwork is DataUniTorâs unique implementation of blockchain schemes. DataUniTor believes that a self-organized cryptographic Blocknetwork with an evolutionary extension model is the next logical step for blockchain to track complex transactions. The Blocknetwork fuses data sources while also offering additional security features - handling larger volumes, taking fewer instructions and providing a simpler and faster response.     The proprietary solution can integrate modules independently of the product provider, allowing for highly flexible structures. Based on technology demonstrations, we assess to be at TRL 6.     The overriding objective of the Feasibility Study is to map out the full development and commercialization of the Blocknetwork scheme. We will analyse the technical and economic feasibility of achieving a fast market uptake to exploit a near-term â¬ 133 mill. business opportunity (revenue 2019E-2022E) based on targeting sophisticated medium to large private and public enterprises (B2B).",

The sources of these threats have been heterogeneous, as well as weapons to impact the population. As Europeans, we know now that we must increase our awareness against these attacks that can strike the places we rely upon the most and destabilize our institutions remotely. Today, the lines between physical and cyber worlds are increasingly blurred. Nearly everything is connected to the Internet and if not, physical intrusion might rub out the barriers. Threats cannot be analysed solely as physical or cyber, and therefore it is critical to develop an integrated approach in order to fight against such combination of threats. Health services are at the same time among the most critical infrastructures and the most vulnerable ones. They are widely relying on information systems to optimize organization and costs, whereas ethics and privacy constraints severely restrict security controls and thus increase vulnerability. The aim of this proposal is to provide solutions that will improve physical and cyber security in a seamless and cost-effective way. It will promote new technologies and novel approaches to enhance threat prevention, threat detection, incident response and mitigation of impacts. The project will also participate in increasing the compliance between security tools and European regulations about ethics and privacy for health services. Finally, project pilots will take place in the hospitals of Marseille, Turin and Amsterdam, involving security and health practitioners, in order to simulate attack scenarios in near-real conditions. These pilot sites will serve as reference examples to disseminate the results and find customers across Europe.",

	"teaser": "The cybersecurity panorama is alarming: cyberattacks in EU are costing businesses approx. â¬208 billion/year (1.6% of GDP), i.e. around â¬1.6 to â¬10.8 million per company. Indeed, 97% of companies are breached, only 53% of attacks are detected by internal resources and each attack takes a mean time of 99 days to be detected. Even though 90% of costs derived from cyberattacks are caused by vulnerabilities in production systems, companies still pose a reactive attitude towards attacks: 90% of them consider security an afterthought, trying to patch the eventual vulnerabilities once the system has been developed; and common security controls are focused on âfirefightingâ attacks towards systems in the production stage instead of preventing them. However, each defect in a production system costs up to 95 times more than in the development stage, so it is clear that a more preventive approach for cybersecurity would decrease by orders of magnitude the damages caused by attacks by unveiling in earlier stages the vulnerabilities of IT systems. In order to solve these problems, ADVERSARY is a novel cybersecurity platform that helps companies minimising vulnerabilities from the very early stages of development, thanks to effective training of IT Managers and SW Developers. Our platform provides tools for hands-on cybersecurity training through a gamified experience that fosters participation, comprehension and reduces drop-outs. These activities are performed in real environments where users can experience different phenomena, and this active learning has shown to be 80% to 800% more effective for acquiring knowledge and skills. By receiving proper training on cybersecurity, our users are able to prevent vulnerabilities from the early stage of development, minimising the greater damage caused in the later stage of production.",

Patients rightly expect full privacy, except where permission has been explicitly given, but they equally expect to be provided with the best possible medical treatment. Evidence suggests that integrating home-based healthcare into a holistic treatment plan is more cost effective, reduces travel-associated risks and costs, and increases the quality of health-care provision, by allowing the incorporation of more frequent home-, work- and environment-based monitoring and testing into medical diagnostics. There is a strong and urgent demand to deliver better, more efficient and more effective healthcare solutions that can achieve excellent patient-centric healthcare provision, while also complying with increasingly strict regulations on the use and sharing of patient data. This provision needs to be multi-site, crossing traditional physical and professional boundaries of hospitals, health centers, home and workplace, and even national borders. It needs to engage hospitals, medical practitioners, consultants and other specialists, as well as incorporating patient-provided data that is produced by personal monitoring devices, health-care apps, environmental monitoring etc. This creates huge pressures The goal of the SERUMS project is to put patients at the center of future health-care provision, enhancing their personal care, and maximizing the quality of treatment that they can receive, while ensuring trust in the security and privacy of their confidential medical data.",

This is a timely research problem, as the rapid growth of cyber-attacks is expected to continue its upwards trajectory. Such growth presents a prominent threat to normal business operations and the EU society itself. On the other hand, an interesting, well-known, finding is that an organisation's computer systems may be less secure than a competitor's, despite having spent more money in securing them. Budget setting, cyber security investment choices and cyber insurance, in the face of uncertainties, are highly challenging tasks with massive business implications. SECONDO aims to make impact on the operation of EU businesses who often: (i) have a limited cyber security budget; and (ii) ignore the importance of cyber insurance. Cyber insurance can play a critical role to the mitigation of cyber risk. This can be done by imposing a cost on firms' cyber risk through a premium that they have to pay and the potential for paying a smaller premium should they reduce their current cyber security risk. SECONDO has a cross-disciplinary nature, combining mathematical and engineering insights to empower innovative software. Apart from the novel research results, the project will offer a software platform to narrow the gap between theoretical understanding and practice. To achieve this, the four industrial project partners will i) lead the part of the project where industrial needs will be entered as input to the requirements collection phase, and, ii) provide their innovative software for risk assessment. The three academic partners will work together to i) design and thoroughly describe the proposed methodologies, but also ii) contribute to their software development.",

The result will be a one-stop shop for methods and tools to achieve highly intelligent, agile and reconfigurable production, which will ensure Europeâs welfare in the future. The network will start its operation by developing demonstrators in the areas of robotics we identified as the most promising to advance agile production, e.g. collaborative robotics including sensory systems to ensure safety, effective user interfaces based on augmented reality and speech, reconfigurable robot workcells and peripheral equipment (fixtures, jigs, grippers, â¦), programming by demonstration, IoT, secure wireless networks, etc. These demonstrators will serve as reference implementation for two rounds of open calls for application experiments, where companies with agile production needs and sound business plans will be supported by TRINITY DIHs to advance their manufacturing processes. Besides technology-centered services, primarily laboratories with advanced robot technologies and know-how to develop innovative application experiments, TRINITY network of DIHS will also offer training and consulting services, including support for business planning and access to financing. Services of participating DIHs and dissemination of information to wider public will be provided through a digital access point that will be developed in the project. Another important activity of the project will be the preparation of a business plan to sustain the network after the end of the project funding.",

	"teaser": "This ERC project pushes the boundary of reliable data-driven decision making in cyber-physical systems (CPS), by bridging reinforcement learning (RL), nonparametric estimation and robust optimization. RL is a powerful abstraction of decision making under uncertainty and has witnessed dramatic recent breakthroughs. Most of these successes have been in games such as Go - well specified, closed environments that - given enough computing power - can be extensively simulated and explored. In real-world CPS, however, accurate simulations are rarely available, and exploration in these applications is a highly dangerous proposition.     We strive to rethink Reinforcement Learning from the perspective of reliability and robustness required by real-world applications. We build on our recent breakthrough result on safe Bayesian optimization (SAFE-OPT): The approach allows - for the first time - to identify provably near-optimal policies in episodic RL tasks, while guaranteeing under some regularity assumptions that with high probability no unsafe states are visited - even if the set of safe parameter values is a priori unknown.     While extremely promising, this result has several fundamental limitations, which we seek to overcome in this ERC project. To this end we will (1) go beyond low-dimensional Gaussian process models and towards much richer deep Bayesian models; (2) go beyond episodic tasks, by explicitly reasoning about the dynamics and employing ideas from robust control theory and (3) tackle bootstrapping of safe initial policies by bridging simulations and real-world experiments via multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, and by pursuing safe active imitation learning.     Our research is motivated by three real-world CPS applications, which we pursue in interdisciplinary collaboration: Safe exploration of and with robotic platforms; tuning the energy efficiency of photovoltaic powerplants and safely optimizing the performance of a Free Electron Laser.",

	"teaser": "The digital revolution, in particular big data and artificial intelligence (AI), offer new opportunities to transform healthcare. However, it also harbors risks to the safety of sensitive clinical data stored in critical healthcare ICT infrastructure. In particular data exchange over the internet is perceived insurmountable posing a roadblock hampering big data based medical innovations. FeatureCloudâs transformative security-by-design concept will minimize the cyber-crime potential and enable first secure cross-border collaborative data mining endeavors. FeatureCloud will be implemented into a software toolkit for substantially reducing cyber risks to healthcare infrastructure by employing the world-wide first privacy-by-architecture approach, which has two key characteristics: (1) no sensitive data is communicated through any communication channels, and (2) data is not stored in one central point of attack. Federated machine learning (for privacy-preserving data mining) integrated with blockchain technology (for immutability and management of patient rights) will safely apply next-generation AI technology for medical purposes. Importantly, patients will be given effective means of revoking previously given consent at any time. Our ground-breaking new cloud-AI infrastructure only exchanges learned model representations which are anonymous by default. Collectively, our highly interdisciplinary consortium from IT to medicine covers all aspects of the value chain: assessment of cyber risks, legal considerations and international policies, development of federated AI technology coupled to blockchaining, app store and user interface design, implementation as certifiable prognostic medical devices, evaluation and translation into clinical practice, commercial exploitation, as well as dissemination and patient trust maximization. FeatureCloudâs goals are bold, necessary, achievable, and paving the way for a socially agreeable big data era of the Medicine 4.0 age.",

	"title": "Samurai - Platform detecting and preventing cyber violence",
	"teaser": "Cyber violence is an increasingly growing concern among children and adolescents. Number of children admitted to hospitals for attempted suicide or expressing suicidal thoughts doubled between 2008 and 2015 - much of the rise is linked to an increase in cyberbullying. Problem conerns also adults - EU estimates that 1 in 10 women have experienced some form of cyber violence. Online violence causes a massive outflow of portal and game users - more than 20% of players left the game due to cyberbullying and 35.8% of women quit playing temporarily because of sexism. These kinds of actions results in a significant reduction of revenues for entities in the industry. Therefore, the health and economic implications of cyber violence provide a compelling multimillion business opportunity. Fido has developed a game-changing Samurai system, artificial intelligence solution dedicated to real-time, automated prevention of online violence in text communication, based on a novel patent. The recent studies show that that our technology detects the most violence and raises false alarms four times less often than the current solutions.  Fido main customers are game industry players, communication/education platforms and social media. During the first 5 years of commercialisation of Samurai we expect to generate EUR12,7 m in turnover and hire additional 18 workers.   Fido Voice is a high-tech Polish SME, supported by business angels, specialising in artificial intelligence and natural language understanding. Our technology was recognised as one of the 100 most promising artificial intelligence solutions in the world (Top 100 AI CBInsights 2017). The founders of Fido were chosen one of Top 100 Innovators Group awarded by Google and Financial Times.",

	"title": "D-FENCE: Deceptive Monitored Environments for Cybersecurity in Enterprises",
	"teaser": "The ineffectiveness of current cybersecurity solutions is alarming: 97% of entities are vulnerable to the more and more sophisticated attacks of hackers and the reported incidences have multiplied its number by 18 from 2009 to 2015. This is causing massive annual losses of approx. â¬38Bn/year only in Europe, with an average damage of â¬9.5M per company attacked. The rising trend on the Internet of Things, expected to bring 50 Bn connected devices by 2020, will multiply by orders of magnitude the risks of cybercrime and so the potential damages. Aiming to tackle this challenge, we present D-FENCE, an advanced cybersecurity solution that applies Cyber Deception to âcheat the hackersâ. D-FENCE creates lures (credentials, HTML tags, cookiesâ¦) and distributes them across the real production systems. These lures point to our decoys, i.e. false endpoints (PCs, serversâ¦) that mimic real assets. When attackers try to access the decoys (and they will do), an alarm is immediately triggered, so it is possibly to rapidly detect, monitor, analyse and counteract any attack. Meanwhile, the real assets are safe from the attacker, who is tangled in our deceptive virtual environment. According to our preliminary experiences, D-FENCE enables 70% more effective and 95% faster detection of attacks compared to existing cybersecurity solutions, meaning potential savings of billions â¬ per year. We, Cybertrap GmbH, are an Austrian start-up devoted to create cybersecurity solutions. The D-FENCE Project is the natural continuation of our previous achievements and brings an enormous opportunity not only for our company but also for the European and global economy. The enhanced prevention, detection and counteraction capabilities provided by D-FENCE will enable companies saving hundreds of thousands to millions â¬ per entity and billions â¬ at EU level. For our company, D-FENCEâs commercialisation will have as well remarkable impact: \\â¬13.3M revenues and at least 30 new job positions by 2023.",

To do so the project develops a set of in-vehicle and V2X data collectors that will feed nIoVeâs machine learning platform and tools for threat analysis and situational awareness across the IoV ecosystem. Advanced visual and data analytics are further enhanced and adapted to boost cyber-threat detection performance under complex attack scenarios, while IoV stakeholders are jointly engaged in incident response activities through trusted mechanisms. The proposed approach is supported by interoperable data exchange between existing and newly proposed cybersecurity tools. nIoVe solution will be demonstrated and validated in 3 pilots: Hybrid execution environment, simulated environment and real-world conditions. Overall, nIoVe ambitiously expects to (i) reduce the attack surface of the overall IoV ecosystem, (ii) showcase effective and real-time detection of novel advanced threats and cyber-attacks in IoV ecosystems; (iii) reduce substantially the response time and reduce drastically the impact of breaches; (iv) contribute to the establishment and sustainable operation of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) stimulating information and knowledge sharing across the IoV ecosystem; and (v) paves the way for the next generation robust, scalable and resilient IoV infrastructure. nIoVe draws and builds upon the accumulated experience from its consortium consisted of 13 partners from 6 European countries and Israel, will implement the project, which is organized in 8 workpackages and will be completed within 36 months.",

	"teaser": "Evolving business models are progressively reshaping the scope and structure of ICT services, with massive introduction of virtualization paradigms and tight integration with the physical environment. Several market forces are already driving towards the creation of multi-domain and complex business service chains, which undoubtedly bring more agility in service deployment and operation but introduce additional security and privacy concerns that have not been addressed in a satisfactory way yet.   Tackling conflicting trends in the cybersecurity market, like fragmentation or vendor lock-ins, GUARD will develop an open and extensible platform for advanced assurance and protection of trustworthy and reliable business chains spanning multiple administrative domains and heterogeneous infrastructures. The purpose of GUARD is manifold: i) to increase the information base for analysis and detection, while preserving privacy, ii) to improve the detection capability by data correlation between domains and sources, iii) to verify reliability and dependability by formal methods that take into account configuration and trust properties of the whole chain, and iv) to increase awareness by better propagation of knowledge to the humans in the loop.   The distinctive approach of GUARD will be the architectural separation between analysis and data sources, mediated by proper abstraction; this paradigm will result in an open, modular, pluggable, extendable, and scalable security framework. This holistic solution will blend security-by-design with enhanced inspection and detection techniques, raising situational awareness at different levels of the companiesâ structure by tailored informative contents, so to enable quick and effective reaction to cyber-threats. Demonstration and validation in two challenging scenarios is envisioned to bring the technology to an acceptable level of maturity, as well as direct involvement of relevant stakeholders for concrete business planning.",

	"teaser": "Incoming files present one of the most serious threats to every corporate network. Cyber attackers have the knowledge and resources to implement highly sophisticated attacks using various methods such as encrypted and distributed malware attacks, zero-day attacks and more. These are delivered via files which are introduced into the target network by various channels, including email, removable media, and web download. Malware attacks can create serious damage to the organization but current available defensive measures fail to provide any protection against such attack. The SMEs, accounting for over 95% of firms, require and demand special response to the vulnerability they have against cyberattacks.  Yet, none of the existing solutions in the market, even less those based on military technology, is giving answer to them. ODIX 2.0 is the next generation of malware protection that is revolutionizing the way organizations protect their company from known and unknown threats. While other solutions focus on analysing userâs behaviour and statistical data to try and DETECT the undetectable, our game changing approach is to proactively PROTECT, sanitizing every file (keeping their full functionality) with our unique anti malware technology.  After carrying out a feasibility study considering technical, practical, and financial aspects, we have successfully confirmed  ODIXâs viability as a significant business opportunity.  Through SMEi-Phase 2 we plan to 1) Enrich our solution with innovative features and functionalities, evolving ODIX-2.0 from  TRL6 To TRL9; 2) pave the way towards its successful international market exploitation; 3) develop an operational strategy  to grow our company based on the SME market, the power to easily and cost-effectively protect their files. Thus, in the next  two years, ODI aims to accelerate its global rollout by expanding engagements with existing clients, and gaining new  customers in key areas in Europe, US and Asia.",

IIoT has great potential to enable significant advances in optimizing operations among large number of increasingly autonomous control systems and devices, and can have a profound impact on many industry domains, where smart factories and logistics are among most notable cases. However, a major barrier towards IIoT adoption lies in cybersecurity issues that makes it extremely difficult to harness its full potential: IIoT systems dramatically increase the attack surface (introducing new security threats due to newly connected devices and protocols, making them more vulnerable to interference), the disruption of process controls, the theft of intellectual property, the loss of corporate data, and the industrial espionage. C4IIoT will build and demonstrate a novel and unified IIoT cybersecurity framework for malicious and anomalous behavior anticipation, detection, mitigation, and end-user informing. The framework provides a holistic and disruptive security-enabling solution for minimizing attack surfaces in IIoT systems, by exploiting i) emerging security software and hardware protection mechanisms; ii) state of the art machine and deep learning and privacy-aware analytics; iii) novel encrypted network flow analysis; iv) secure-by-design IIoT device fabrication; and v) blockchain technologies, to provide a viable scheme for enabling security and accountability, preserving privacy, enabling reliability and assuring trustworthiness within IIoT applications.

CYBERCULT has three core objectives. First, it will establish a Strategic Culture-based theoretical concept that explains the development and use of OCC by western powers. This concept will move beyond rationalist and materialist explanations of OCC processes and consider the influence of Strategic Culture on OCC adoption, including the socio-political, historical, and perceptual/ideational factors involved. This will be achieved through a theory-building phase involving an Interdisciplinary Workshop on OCC, a literature review on Strategic Culture and new technologies, and sustained interaction with leading Strategic Culture academics. Second, CYBERCULT will produce a data set on perceptions of OCC in eight countries that are connected to the western alliance system: the US, Israel, France, Germany, the UK, Estonia, Japan and New Zealand. The data set will be based on an analysis of surveys sent out to cyber policymakers and practitioners in the eight countries. Third, CYBERCULT will produce an in-depth comparative analysis of OCC adoption in three of the world's leading cyber powers: the US, Israel, and France. This will be based on primary and secondary sources and twenty interviews with scholars, government officials, and cyber industry representatives in each of the three countries. CYBERCULT will have sustained links to policymaking and industry and will help to inform fast-moving cyber security processes in the EU and NATO, including the EU Cyber Security Strategy and NATO Cyber Defence Policy. CYBERCULT will be hosted by Recherche et Etudes en Politique Internationale (REPI), UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium).

These threats must be tackled under a holistic approach and pointing at their different origins, including the human factor. The European Union is reinforcing the legal framework to contribute to this need, including important requirements to be fulfilled, especially in the context of critical sectors identified under the NIS Directive. Finance is one of them, actually the most restrictive, because of the number of regulations to comply with. This makes finance the perfect scenario for testing tools, before transferring the results to other sectors. That is why SOTER is mainly focused on it, aiming at providing a comprehensive set of tools that will act as a transformative process of the finance sector, helping their players to increase their cybersecurity level, enabling the fight against present and future cyberattacks and vulnerabilities. The results will then increase their cyber-resilience.  SOTER main results will be: SOTER Digital Onboarding Platform (the technology tool to provide a robust and sovereign digital identity, facilitating the interconnections between different services providers and the users), improved by the use of blockSOTER will offer tools that are able to determine the level of cyber security that exists in a certain entity, to improve if that is the case. We intend to get this through a comprehensive risk analysis to create contingency plans and direct action measures that can mitigate threats and security attacks.    In the case of the finance sector, we propose to test and analyze a cloud platform of Digital Onboarding with two main features:   â¢ use of technologies blockchain  â¢ innovative systems of biometric identification of users    Derived from this, training actions for end users will be generated so they are able to detect and deal with this type of threats.",

At the same time, attack mechanisms are increasingly sophisticated, pervading critical infrastructures despite billions of euros invested in cybersecurity measures. To address the above, SPIDER delivers an innovative Cyber Range as a Service platform that extends and combines the capabilities of existing telecommunication testbeds and cyber ranges into a unified facility for (i) testing new security technologies, (ii) training modern cyber defenders in near real-world conditions, and (iii) supporting organisations and relevant stakeholders in making optimal cybersecurity investment decisions. At its core, it is a highly customisable dynamic network modelling instrument that enables real-life virtualisation and real-time emulation of networks and systems. It also offers real-time interaction and information sharing capabilities by acting as a serious gaming repository for multiple stakeholders to share material and maximise efficiency in delivering complex cyber exercises. SPIDERâs gamified learning environment enables trainees to master how to use domain-specific cyber protection technologies and collaboratively improve their ability in handling incidents and risks. Complemented by cyber econometric capabilities, SPIDER also enables users to forecast the evolution of attacks and their associated economic impact through the application of innovative risk analysis methodologies, econometric models and real-time attack emulation. The proposed cyber range model will be validated in five highly realistic pilot use case scenarios aimed at demonstrating its applicability and validity for all requirements of the SU-DS01-2018 Call (simulation, training, and economics).",

	"teaser": "The EnergyShield project will develop an integrated toolkit covering the complete EPES value chain (generator, TSO, DSO, consumer). The toolkit combines novel security tools from leading European technology vendors and will be validated in large-scale demonstrations by end-users.  The EnergyShield toolkit will combine the latest technologies for vulnerability assessment (automated threat modelling and security behaviour analysis), monitoring & protection (anomaly detection and DDoS mitigation) and learning & sharing (security information and event management).   The integrative approach of the project is unique as insights produced by the various tools will be combined to provide a unique level of visibility to the users. For example, it will be possible to combine vulnerability scanning with automated threat modelling to provide insights into software vulnerabilities present in an architecture in combination with insights into what are the key assets, risks and weak links of the architecture. The toolbox will allow end-users to predict future attacks (as it provides insights to what attacks can be applied to the weakest links of the architecture) and learn from past attacks (for example using the insights from the vulnerability assessment and threat modelling to prevent attacks, and learning from attacks to update the probabilistic meta-model of the threat modelling).  The toolkit will be implemented with the complete EPES value chain who will contribute to the specification, prototyping and demonstration phases of the project. Although the toolkit will be tailored to the needs of EPES operators, many of the technology building blocks and best practices will be transferable to other types of critical infrastructures.   The consortium consists of 2 large industrial partners (SIVECO and PSI), whereof SIVECO is taking the lead supported by 6 innovative SMEs, 3 academic research organizations and 7 end-users representing various parts of the EPES value chain.",

The increased usage of information technology in modern CIIs means that they are becoming more vulnerable to the activities of hackers and other perpetrators of cyber-related crime (cyber criminals). Several recent studies have shown that the landscape of cyber threats is changing continuously and the nature of attacks of this sort are evolving, involving a great degree of persistence and (technical) sophistication.   In addition to this, barriers to entry for would-be cyber criminals are falling rapidly, and nowadays, the attackers have a range of (technical) capabilities and substantial resources at their disposal, since malware and malware-as-a service become more easily and cheaply available through various means and sources (such as Dark Web, Deep Web). Thus, a variety of advanced techniques and tools (e.g. social engineering techniques and zero-day exploits programs) are available and can be used by the cyber criminals to initiate advanced targeted attacks. These threats employ multiple technologies and malware, deployed in multiple stages, to bypass traditional security mechanisms in order to penetrate an organizationâs defenses. The attack vectors vary significantly including Application-Layer, Social Engineering Unauthorized Access, Malicious Code, and Reconnaissance and Networking-based service attacks that target applications, host and client operating systems, and even networking equipment. In this vein, the attackers use these techniques to get valuable data assets, such as financial transaction information, user credentials, insider information etc.",

It has become a forum and marketplace for weapons, drugs, organs, illicit pornography, software exploits, stolen private data, passwords, credit card details, counterfeit products and money. Illegal services are offered, like phishing, cyber-attacks, murder and rape for hire and money laundering.  Criminal investigation authorities began to investigate cases of crimes and terrorism in the Dark Web, but struggle to access, handle and analyse the immense amount of data, and urgently need an isolated solution to acquire solid evidence legally applicable in court. For corporations, the potential economic and image damage of cyber-attacks is extensive. They search adequate solutions to acquire cyber threat intelligence, to identify threats, enhance cyber defence and allow a fast and effective response. Up to now, commercial state-of-the-art solutions force users to into 3rd party services or to access crawled data on online clouds.  Mh SERVICE developed DAN, a Kiosk solution for darknet analysis. It includes high-performance hardware, pre-installed and pre-configured intuitive software, as well as user training and seminars. The acquired data is isolated from the possibility of foreign access or manipulation by third persons to ensure the chain of evidence for investigation authorities and privacy for companies. During the feasibility study of DAN, we tested the prototype at several customers and now optimise and redesign the DAN to perfectly fulfil the user needs from both segments.  With a rapidly growing global threat intelligence market (3.8 bn US$ in 2017, CAGR 2017-22: 18.4%) we conservatively anticipate a turnover of 10Mâ¬ for DAN in 2023 and additional 11.3Mâ¬ from our existing business.  With 25 yearsâ experience, mh SERVICE GmbH is one of todayâs leading providers and suppliers of products and services related to IT forensics. mh is Europeâs only forensics supplier with its own hardware development and manufacturing departments.",

Legacy data transmission is not encrypted for existing datalink capabilities and protocol. As a consequence, it is very hard to identify if failure is a malfunction or an attack.  However, civil aviation is an increasingly attractive target for cyber-attacks. New technologies such as e-enabled aircraft and modern CNS/ATM systems, together with trends towards greater connectivity, reliance on technology, common infrastructure underpinned with common technologies with common standards, etc. â¦ are changing the risk landscape of the aviation system.    The consequences of a potential cyber-attack in civil aviation are wide and can include:   (i) Lost of trust in new systems & concepts, limiting their successful deployment;  (ii) A 'domino effect' of failures across connected systems or common components;  (iii) Closure of the air traffic management system for unpredictable periods; â¦  Since there is not a 'silver bullet' technology that will secure the aeronautical domain, it is essential to:  (i) Investigate measures to make the current systems more resilient against cyber-threats  (ii) To establish effective and automated solutions for intrusion detection;   (iii) Promote its implementation worldwide and build trust across stakeholders.    Considering aforementioned challenges, the vACCINE Project aims to design an aircraft onboard security filter with an accuracy level of intrusion detection compatible with cyber protection objectives. The objective is to check/control data from the ground domain before authorizing them to enter the avionics domain not to compromise this level of safety.  Based modern digital transformation concepts and cyber-security technologies, the Project will deploy an innovative approach to catalyse the resilient of existing aeronautical communication systems against cyber-threat.",

This is achieved by delivering an ecosystem of networked realistic training and simulation platforms that collaboratively bring unique cyber-security aspects from the aviation, smart grid and naval domains. The proposed platform will extend the capabilities of existing cyber-ranges and will allow the creation of complex cross-domain/hybrid scenarios to be built jointly with the IoT domain. Emphasis is given on the design and implementation of realistic and dynamic scenarios that are based on identified and forecasted trends of cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities extracted from cyber-threat intelligence gathered from the dark web; this will enable cyber-security professionals to rapidly adapt to an evolving threat landscape. The development of advanced risk analysis and econometric models will prove to be valuable in estimating the impact of cyber-risks, selecting the most appropriate and affordable security measures, and minimising the cost and time to recover from cyber-attacks. Innovative training curricula, guiding cyber-security professionals to implement and combine security measures using new technologies and established learning methodologies, will be created and employed for training needs; they will be linked to professional certification programs and be supported by learning platforms. Aside from the development of skills, the project aims at a holistic approach to cyber-threat management with the ultimate goal of cultivating a strong security culture. As such, the project puts considerable emphasis on research and development (i.e. research on cyber-threats, development of novel ideas, etc) as the key to increasing training dynamics and awareness methods for exceeding the rate of evolution of cyber-attackers",

Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are adopted to implement flexible and efficient distributed security and trust across the various parties involved in a 5G end-to-end service chain. With these, we can implement an evolved 5G Service Layer for Smart Contracts among multiple non-trusted parties, to allow SLA monitoring, spectrum sharing, intelligent and automated data-driven resource discovery and management. Our cross domain security & trust orchestration coupled with service lifecycle automation can enforce security policies in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments.

Criminal behaviours like financial frauds, intellectual property theft, industrial espionage, and terrorist networks leverage the Internet and cyberspace. The very ubiquity of digital devices, e.g. smartphones, in modern society makes digital evidence extremely relevant for investigations about all kinds of criminal behaviour like murder, contraband activities, and people smuggling, to name a few.  Due to its nature, the use of digital evidence in a court of law has always been challenging. It is critical that it should be accompanied by a proper chain of custody, guaranteeing its source and integrity.  LOCARD aims to provide a holistic platform for chain of custody assurance along the forensic workflow, a trusted distributed platform allowing the storage of digital evidence metadata in a blockchain.  Each node of LOCARD will be able to independently set its own permission policies and to selectively share access to digital evidence with other nodes when deemed necessary and upon proper authorization through fine-grained policies. LOCARD's modularity will also allow diverse actors to tailor the platform to their specific needs and role in the digital forensic workflow, from preparation and readiness, to collection, to analysis and reporting.  LOCARD will have a crowdsource module to collect citizen reports of selected violations, a crawler to detect and correlate online deviant behaviour, and a toolkit for investigators that will assist them in collecting online and offline evidence.  This will be powered by an immutable storage and an identity management system that will protect privacy and handle access to evidence data using a Trusted Execution Environment. Blockchain technology will not only guarantee that information about the evidence cannot be tampered with, but allow interoperability without the need for a trusted third party.",

	"teaser": "The goal of INSPIRE-5Gplus is to advance security of 5G and Beyond networks via two main approaches: (1) by leveraging/extending existing assets such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Remote Attestation/Path Proof/RCA (Root Cause Analysis), and end-to-end liability management between parties, and (2) by introducing novel solutions/paradigms exploiting the potential of new trends including AI/ML and Blockchains. Accordingly, the INSPIRE-5Gplus project will address key security challenges against the concrete and efficient realisation of 5G through vertical applications, ranging from autonomous and connected cars to Critical Industry 4.0 (under specific regulation constraints).   Grounded in an integrated network management system and relevant frameworks, INSPIRE-5Gplus is entirely devoted to improve security at various dimensions (i.e., overall vision, use cases, architecture, integration to network management, assets, and models). It is also committed to deliver actionable results and enablers for all relevant stakeholders at both Program and Community levels. These outcomes will serve the crucial objectives of intelligent security and pervasive trust for future connected systems where Security will not be software-defined only, but will also be governed by Algorithms (AI, ML, Modeling, Optimization) to realize new concepts such as pro-active security while being trustworthy. Through its objectives, INSPIRE-5Gplus will deliver unique assets to achieve intelligent and trusted multi-tenancy (i.e. confident, evidence-based, and liable) across multi-tenants infrastructure, whilst also improving the control of systems, vulnerabilities and compromises for the infrastructure owners and tenants.",

	"teaser": "AERAS aims to develop a realistic and rapidly adjustable cyber range platform for systems and organisations in the critical healthcare sector, to effectively prepare stakeholders with different types of responsibility and levels of expertise in defending high-risk, critical cyber-systems and organizations against advanced, known and new cyber-attacks, and reduce their security risks. The platform will be a virtual cyberwarfare solution enabling the simulation of the operation and effects of security controls and offering hands-on training on their development, assessment, use and management.  The platform will be based on an evidence-based approach where virtual cyberwarfare and simulations are configured according to evidence regarding: (i) the occurrence of cyber threats, and (ii) the effectiveness of the operation of the internal and external system defence mechanisms. Evidence will be collected by multi- faceted real-time monitoring and assessed according to Cyber Range Security Assurance (CRSA) models specifying potential cyber-attacks, the security mechanisms used against them, and the methods for assessing their effectiveness. The AERAS solution will be delivered at TRL-7 and validated through two different pilots in the healthcare sector: (i) a hospital medical systems pilot; and (ii) a public health systems pilot.",

	"title": "Intelligent software-UPDATE technologies for safe and secure mixed-criticality and high performance cyber physical systems",
	"teaser": "Mixed-Criticality Cyber-Physical Systems (MCCPS) deployed in critical domains like automotive and railway are starting to use Over The Air Software Updates (OTASU) for functionality improvement, bug fixing, and solving security vulnerabilities (among others). But, OTASU entails several difficulties: 1) Safety including non-functional properties like real-time, functional safety, and energy-efficiency. 2) Security. OTASU creates entry points for hackers 3) Availability. During updates the system is not available. While this is just inconvenient for mainstream devices, this is not acceptable for critical MCCPS that must remain active during operation.   Additionally, computing performance needs are bigger and therefore complex hardware platforms based on multicore processors and accelerators are used in MCCPS. Such complex hardware platforms, software applications are subject to intricate dependences in their functional and non-functional behaviour.   For facing these two trends in MCCPS: OTASU and complex hardware platforms, that entails relevant research challenges, the UP2DATE project propose: a new software paradigm for SAfety and SEcurity (SASE) software updates for intelligent and resource intensive MCCPS, promoting a safety and security concept that builds around composability and modularity as main properties to enable a dynamic (post-deployment) validation of SASE properties.  A high quality and complementary consortium comprising knowledge generators (IKL, BSC and OFFIS) plus technology integrators (IAV and TTA) and two end uses from the automotive and railway sector (MM and CAF), will be able to test in two uses cases a new software architecture that will enable the runtime deployment of new (mixed-criticality) applications remotely (patching existing functions or extending the functionality) in heterogeneous computing platforms.   The total budget foreseen for this research project is around â¬3.8M.",

	"title": "Integrated development and operations management framework for cyber-physical systems of systems under the paradigm of swarm intelligence",
	"teaser": "Recent years have seen the widespread diffusion of low-cost computational systems, triggering the transition towards even further decentralization towards the Edge of autonomic intelligence. While in the consumer domain this transformation is happening very fast, industrial applications are inevitably more conservative and require solid methodological and technological grounds to guarantee this transition to be dependable.  1-SWARM project focuses on the design-operations for CPSoS with the specific focus on industrial sector of large-scale distribution and logistics. The project aims at achieving industrially acceptable level of robustness of CPSoS whose operation emerges as âSwarm Intelligenceâ. 1-SWARMâs solution will span across different steps of the value chain, connecting intelligence through the digital domain to maximize their effectiveness and reliability. The objective is to provide a methodological and technological framework, modular and re-usable (âSwarm Intelligence DevOps Frameworkâ), for the engineering of the three major aspects of CPSoS: i) The HW/SW runtime platform that sustains their operations; ii) The distributed and orchestrated Intelligence that guarantees their autonomic behavior; iii) The extension of their âexistenceâ into the cyber-domain for a full life-cycle approach.  Key to the exploitability of 1-SWARMâs result is the demonstration of its potentialities for 4 different application scenarios, whose requirements come from cross-domain use-cases, whose variability allows extensive validation of the project technologies: 1) Manufacturing CPSoS for food packaging; 2) Logistics CPSoS for reconfigurable material handling; 3) Fleets of intelligent AGVs in complex dynamic environment; 4) Aerial drones flock for extensive monitoring of retails shops.  Strong of its open and standard-based approach, 1-SWARM will create an international collaborative framework for the CPSoS domain, supporting extensively relevant standardization activities.",
